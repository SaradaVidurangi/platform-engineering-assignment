 DevOps vs. Platform Engineering
 DevOps is a practice that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software. It emphasizes automation, CI/CD, monitoring, and feedback loops.
Platform Engineering, on the other hand, focuses on building internal platforms (such as self-service deployment systems, infrastructure automation, or developer portals) to improve developer productivity and standardize DevOps best practices across teams.

|------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Focus                  | Process and collaboration           | Tools and internal platforms           |
| Goal                   | Automate delivery and operations    | Streamline development experience      |
| Teams                  | Developers + Ops                    | Dedicated Platform Team                |

Rise of DevSecOps
DevSecOps integrates security into the DevOps pipeline from the very beginning. It automates security checks (e.g., static code analysis, vulnerability scanning) and treats security as a shared responsibility across teams.

Early vulnerability detection
Automated compliance
Faster remediation
Secure by design

DevSecOps ensures that development is fast, scalable, and secure, helping organizations meet increasing cybersecurity demands.
